== Description ==
This plugin registers the RactiveJS Framework library as part of Wordpress.  This means that Ractive scripts can be included in your plugins by just enqueuing the scripts.  Please see FAQ for usage for your plugin.

NOTE:  This does not add any ability to the wordpress front-end or back-end.  The scripts are disabled by default and must be included in your plugin by enqueuing the scripts as you would for any other scripting engine.  So to reiterate this plugin does not add any extra functionality on its own.  It is designed to be used as a dependancy for other plugins.

= Live, reactive templating =

Ractive.js is a template-driven UI library, but unlike other tools that generate inert HTML, it transforms your templates into blueprints for apps that are interactive by default.

= Powerful and extensible =

Two-way binding, animations, SVG support and more are provided out-of-the-box - but you can add whatever functionality you need by downloading and creating plugins.

= Optimised for your sanity =

Some tools force you to learn a new vocabulary and structure your app in a particular way. Ractive works for you, not the other way around - and it plays well with other libraries.
